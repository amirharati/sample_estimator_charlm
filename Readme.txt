This is a simple practice code to use Estimator API and non-depreciated features of tensorflow (V 1.8) to create and build charecter LM using GRU units.
I have used following features:
1- Dataset
2- Estimator API

This code is based on Tensorflow DNN example (https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/samples/core/get_started/custom_estimator.py) but adapted for RNNs.
